Additional counties to supplement ward files
This data is found in the folder 'data-integrity/vest-wi-2018/raw-data/add_counties' in AWS (i.e. '.../add_counties/pepin for Pepin County, WI). 
There are eight counties (noted in VEST's documentation.txt file and above) that need supplemental ward data from U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release.

All counties' data are inside their respective folders. 
The file that is used inside those folders is the one that contains VTDs and follows this naming structure: PVS_19_v2_vtd_COUNTYFIPS.shp where COUNTYFIPS is the FIPS code for that county (i.e. 55011 for Buffalo County, WI)

All of the required county shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 were selected.
  Downloaded here: https://www.census.gov/geo/partnerships/pvs/partnership20v1/st55_wi.html
  The necessary counties were selected (Buffalo, Clark, Trempeleau, Pepin, Dunn, La Crosse, Grant, and Marquette).
