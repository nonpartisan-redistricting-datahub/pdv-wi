Our final validation report for this dataset is available [here](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2018-wisconsin-precinct-and-election-results/).

We do not have the raw data sources available on this Github due to file constraints, but we are happy to share them if needed.

    - Note: One can download five county VTD shapefiles at a time. Each countyâ€™s data is a zip file with a number of other files, in addition to the VTDs. The VTD filename follow this format: PVS_19_v2_vtd_55[FIPS].All of the counties that required supplemental data from the Phase 2 release, per VEST documentation, are available.
    
    
## Inaccessible files: 
- Election Results and Wards Shapefile from the Wisconsin State Legislature Open Data Portal
- This is the primary file used in the VEST processing. On the Wisconsin LTSB Open Data Portal (https://data-ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com/) , ward boundaries with election results are only available at 2020 and 2011 boundaries (with multiple election years), as of the time of this report. VEST confirmed that they used a 2018 ward boundary file (personal communication, not in documentation), which is not currently available on the website. We were able to retrieve what we believe to be a similar file from the University of Wisconsin: https://geodata.wisc.edu/catalog/B41117FE-B7E9-423A-91C8-E0DF28ACA065 (retireved on 03/08/2021). The University of Wisconsin notes that they retrieved this file from the Wisconsin LTSB and is intended to represent 2018 wards.
